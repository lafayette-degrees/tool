        <p class="paragraph">Hey there, my name is Lafayette° (sometimes written as lafayette.degrees), but most people call me Laufey. If you're wondering where
            that name comes from, it's the name of a mountain up in New Hampshire.<br><br></p>
        <p class="articletitle" style="font-size: 20px;">Who am I?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am a proud Eagle Scout and have been since 2023. I currently go to school
            at a Polytechnic Institute studying computer science with a concentration in cyber-security. I've spent a lot of time on the internet, so I know
            just how important privacy really is. It's one of the last few things we have on the internet, seeing as creativity and honesty have been squandered.
            <br><br> I would consider myself a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I am fluent in several programming languages (C, C++, Java), just now learning web-development,
            skilled with graphic design (Photoshop for 2D, Maya for 3D), experienced with music production (FLStudio20), and also have spent a lot of time working
            on games in Unity. 
            <br><br> Outside of computers however, I really enjoy hiking and camping (wilderness survival in general), as well as biking, and started going to the gym 
            frequently since last Summer. Music is a big passion of mine, and some artists/bands I've been listening to a lot recently (at time of writing) are 
            TOOL, BONES, Gojira, Deftones, and Ye West (mainly his older stuff :/).
        <br><br></p>
        <p class="articletitle" style="font-size: 20px;">What is the purpose of this website?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Mainly so that I have a place on the internet that is 100% mine, to develop web-development skills, and to share my ideas & projects with others.
            I think everyone needs some sort of outlet to express themselves. Do I think my articles/posts/projects contain world changing ideas? Probably not.
            But that won't stop me from trying.<br><br>

            Thanks for reading! <br>
